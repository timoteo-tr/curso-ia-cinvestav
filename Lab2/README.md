# Lab 2
In this practice, you will apply the concepts covered in class. Additionally, this section explains how this and other course assignments will be organized. Most activities will be
divided into three main sections:

Section 1. Programming Practice
This section includes exercises designed to reinforce the topics discussed in class. The goal is to apply the learned concepts by solving practical problems.

Section 2. Documentation Research
In this section, you will search for, analyze, and implement Python elements (functions, classes, or methods) that were not covered during class. The purpose is to complement
your learning and encourage the habit of consulting official documentation. For example, if you are asked to research a Python function, you should explain it and
provide a working example of its use.

Section 3. Error Detection
In this part, you will record errors found during the practice or intentionally generate some to understand their cause and how to fix them.
